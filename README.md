# CodeFellowship

This application functionally implements authorization protocols.  On the home page, one is prompted to either login or
sign up if they are  not already logged in.  If one chooses to signup, they will be directed to a respective sign up 
page.  There they can fill out a form and become a user.  Once submitted, they will be redirected to the home page, but 
now only a logout button will appear, rather than login and logout prompts, since they are already logged in.
